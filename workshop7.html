	<h1>Workshop 7 - Azure Web App Development</h1>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_0.PNG" width="268" height="188" alt="" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>In this week's workshop you will learn how to build a simple web app in VSC and run it locally. The web app will
		give you the foundations on which to display your sensor data as you will call your HTTP Trigger function from
		the web app to pull in the JSON data for displaying in a basic web interface. Please see the below diagram where
		the role of the web app is presented for this module and the assessment:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>-As a reminder, last week in workshop 6 you created a serverless function of the type HTTP Trigger that when
		called it would retrieve the sensor data from your Cosmos Database in JSON format. The sensor data at this point
		is just returned as raw JSON data when you call the function. For this workshop you will create a basic web app
		that will call the function and retrieve the JSON data and displaying in on a basic web interface. You will be
		given some of the code for this, but not code to parse the JSON data and present it in a formatted fashion. You
		are advised to develop your function code so that it only returns the relevant data to the web app, making it
		easy to view and understand the values, you can even add extra functions just to return string values, such as
		the latest value of a sensor.</p>
	<p>There are no more major cloud services to be created and worked on for the assessment after this week, everything
		that is required for the assessment is displayed in the above diagram. The remaining lectures and workshops
		after this week will be focused on covering concepts such as DevOps, publsihing all of your services to the
		cloud, and support.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2> Create an Azure Web App in VSC</h2>
	<p>First, create a folder on your computer called <strong>MyFirstAzureWebApp</strong>, in this example it is under
		My Documents space but you can place it almost anywhere. However, please avoid develop code files on a USB drive
		or folders that are monitored by third party such as Dropbox or OneDrive as you may run into errors.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_2.PNG" width="633" height="331" alt="" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Next open VSC, and installthe Azure Tools extension as shown below:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_1.PNG" width="1066" height="629" alt="" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Now <strong>File > Open Folder</strong> and browse to the MyFirstAzureWebApp folder you creared and open it, it
		will now be displayed in VSC:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_3.PNG" width="389" height="583" alt="" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_4.PNG" width="658" height="481" alt="" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Now click on the <strong>New Terminal</strong> option as shown below:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_5.PNG" width="783" height="458" alt="" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>At the terminal type in: </p>
	<p><strong>dotnet new webapp -f netcoreapp3.1</strong></p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_6.PNG" width="956" height="484" alt="" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>A new web app will be created inside the MyFirstAzureWebApp folder. Now run the new web app with the below
		command:</p>
	<p><strong>dotnet run</strong></p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_7.PNG" width="1292" height="426" alt="" /></p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_8.PNG" width="1014" height="430" alt="" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>In the details above you can see the new web app is running locally at the following url, enter this url in your
		browser and you will see the test page:</p>
	<p><strong>https://localhost:5001</strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_9.PNG" width="1103" height="591" alt="" /></p>
	<p>That is it in terms of create the basic web app template!</p>
	<p>In VSC, you can look at the web app source files on the left pane file explorer, expand as shown in the
		screenshot below and you can see the index.html code that generated the webpage in previous screenshot:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_11.PNG" width="1200" height="693" alt="" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Call your Azure HTTP Trigger Function from the Web App</h2>
	<p>Next you are going to add the code to the web app to call your HTTP Trigger function that you created in workshop
		6. The code in the web app will call the function to retrieve the sensor data in your Cosmos Database.
		It will not do any processing of the JSON data, instead it will simply add an iframe to the home page with the
		source of the iframe set to the function url.
		You are free to look at ways you can parse the data for a more formatted view but this requires extra
		independent work.
		A client side web app would almost always be part of an IoT stack and the purpose of this workshop is to show
		you how a web app can be created and what it can be used for as part of an IoT prototype stack, but you do not
		need to spend much effort on the web app at all.</p>
	<p>You will need to run your HTTP Trigger code in another instance of VSC (with your current instance still open of
		course!) to get the local url of the function while it is running. Refer back to workshop 6 on how to run your
		HTTP trigger code and get the local url for it.</p>
	<p>At this point you should have copied your function url from the other isntance of VSC. From the file explorer of
		the VSC instance with the web app,, open the <strong>index.cshtml</strong> file:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_11.PNG" width="1200" height="693" alt="" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Change the code by replacing it all with the below. Essentially this is adding the iframe element, ensure its
		source is set to your local function url while its running in another instance of VSC.:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<pre><code class="cs">
		@page
		@model IndexModel
		@{
			ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
		}

		&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
			&lt;h1 class="display-4">Last Sensor Value&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;iframe src="http://localhost:7071/api/temperature/"></iframe>
		&lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_12.PNG" width="800" height="365" alt="" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Now run the web app locally by gonig to Run&gt;Start Debugging and copy the local url into your browser:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_13.PNG" width="800" height="305" alt="" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>You should see the modified <strong>index.cshtml</strong> web page with the iframe that calls your HTTP Trigger
		function and displays the raw JSON data:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img src="images/workshop7_14.PNG" width="1000" height="540" alt="" /></p>
	<p>That is all the guided content for this week, please have a look at the independent tasks next. Next week the
		workshop will focus on showing you how to publish all of your functions to a production slot on Azure, as well
		as publishing your web app. When all of your services are published they will be addressable and running over
		the internet instead of locally.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Independent Tasks</h2>
	<p>For reducing the amount of JSON data displayed in your iframe, explore how you can use routes and parameters to
		select and return sensor data based on date or other filters you wish to use. You can also look at modifying the
		SQL query in your trigger function, however remember this is not standard SQL but is a variant of it designed
		for cosmos, read more about it <a
